- 👋 Hi, I’m @andilge
- 👀 I’m interested in electronics and home automations. I'm especially fascinated in controlling lights
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of things, as always. I've been diving deeper into ESPHome the last few years and have recently found a new hobby: design pcbs
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever wakes my interest
- 📫 You can reach me easiest on intermit.tech's discord server https://discord.gg/WdbAauG shouting out for andilge
